## FirstPerson.io

An application which enchances the end-user experience of checking in to establishments and events. Our vision is to immerse the user into a virtual RPG-style game, where experience points (XP) is obtained for check-ins (first time check-ins and repeat check-ins) as well as creating and completing "quests". 

The inclusion of quests makes this app unlike anything else on the market. In a quest, users can follow a series of instructions, which most likely would include checking in to a series of establishments within a given interval of time. The XP awarded to the user who completes the quest would be awarded an increased amount of XP for completing the quest. 

We envision this application to be used by the business and users. Businesses will have the capability to award extra experience points to users for visting their business. End Users could organize hosted events and invite their friends through an engaging RPG experience. 

Ultimately, our application aims to encourage all users to discover new places and be rewarded for their travels and unique experiences.
