/ This is very simplified at the moment. I know that we need to render the selected quest's title, XP award for completing the quest and the quest's description.
.reward_title
  %h1 #{@quest.title} Rewards!

  %br

.rewards_xp
  %h2 For: #{@quest.xp}

  %br

.rewards_description
  %p #{@description}
